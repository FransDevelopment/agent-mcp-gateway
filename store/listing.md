Arcede Agent Gateway

## Short Description (132 chars max)
Turn your browser into a tool gateway for AI agents. Works on any website — with or without WebMCP. One install, universal access.

## Detailed Description

**Your browser is already logged into everything. Now your AI can use it.**

Arcede Agent Gateway discovers tools on every website you visit and makes them available to AI agents through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Browse normally — your AI assistant automatically sees what's available.

**Works on any website:**
• Sites with WebMCP support → tools are discovered instantly
• Sites without WebMCP → tools are auto-generated from forms and search bars
• Popular sites (Gmail, Notion, Stripe) → curated, polished tool definitions included

**One connection, universal access:**
Connect any MCP-compatible AI client — Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, or your own — and it gets structured access to every site you're logged into. No extra API keys. No per-site setup. If you're authenticated in Chrome, your AI can use those tools through your existing session.

**Getting started:**
1. Install the extension
2. Browse to any website — tools appear in the extension popup
3. Connect your MCP client to the extension
4. Your AI can now interact with your sites

**Key features:**
• Discovers WebMCP tools on every page you visit (Chrome 146+)
• Auto-generates tools from forms and search inputs on any site
• Curated tool definitions for popular services — instant, verified quality
• Standard MCP protocol — works with any compatible AI client
• Uses your existing browser sessions — no extra logins needed
• Respects tab lifecycle — tools are cleaned up when tabs close

**Privacy:**
• No data leaves your browser unless you connect an MCP client
• No tracking, no analytics, no account required
• All tool execution happens in your existing page sessions
• Open source: github.com/ArcedeLabs/arcede-agent-gateway

**Requirements:**
• Chrome 146+ recommended for native WebMCP support
• DOM fallback and curated tools work on any Chrome version
